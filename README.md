- images face, Assimilation, A Time To Stand, Harvest Moon, Locked and Wilted are my own work
- this is my first attempt at a complete Plasma 5 Look and Feel theme with a Bash Script installer so there may be issues
- the first time it is used there are several KDE Plasma artifacts to download and install, so please be patient

June 8, 2019: Renamed git repository to "DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-with-Install-Script" to better differenciatte it from the standard "DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-Theme" repository.

June 20, 2019: Testing of several different Linux distros has successfully concluded

July 8, 2019: Version 1.0.1 adds 8 different face icons and updates install.sh

February 7, 2022: The scripts no longer work as well under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS going forward. This appears to be a trend with most custom themes with scripts. However, if it doesn't completly work, try running the process again, it usually sets it right.
